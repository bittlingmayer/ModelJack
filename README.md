## Abstract


This notebook gives an introduction to working with the various data sets in Wikipedia Talk project on Figshare. The release includes:
1. large historical corpus of discussion comments on Wikipedia talk pages
2. sample of over 100k comments with human labels for whether the comment contains a personal attack
3. sample of over 100k comments with human labels for whether the comment has aggressive tone

Please refer to our wiki for documentation of the schema of each data set and our research paper for documentation on the data collection and modeling methodology.

In this notebook we show how to build a simple classifier for detecting personal attacks and apply the classifier to a random sample of the comment corpus to see whether discussions on user pages have more personal attacks than discussion on article pages.
